DReaMLicensor README
======================================================================
----------------------------
Overview
----------------------------
The DReaMLicensor consists of two components: A servlet-based license 
server and a database which serves as a repository of licenses. Each 
license in the database is bound to a combination of userId, shopId, 
and contentId.  The license server provides a web application to add or 
retrieve licenses from the database repository.


----------------------------
Configuration
----------------------------
** Database:
The <database> element in web-inf/conf/license-server.xml, specifies 
the database that the license server will connect to. The sample 
configuration works with a pointbase database.

<database>
	<drivername>com.pointbase.jdbc.jdbcUniversalDriver</drivername>
	<databaseurl>jdbc:PointBase://localhost:9092/sample</databaseurl>
	<username>PBPUBLIC</username>
	<password>PBPUBLIC</password>
	<listTableSql>select * from systables</listTableSql>
	<tableNameColumnNumber>2</tableNameColumnNumber>
</database>

If the above configuration is used, a local Pointbase database must be 
started before accessing the license server web application.

The license server uses a table called "sunlslicenses" to store 
the licenses. If the sunlslicenses table exists, the license server will 
use the existing table. Else,the license server will create a new table.
Separate database initialization scripts are not needed to initialize 
the sunlslicenses table.
 
** Apache Tomcat - 
 
There is a simple admin UI which Adds and Retrieves licenses which can 
be accessed at: http://tomcatserver:8080/LicenseServer/
 
The request for a license from the video client should be in the 
following format:
 
http://tomcatserver:8080/LicenseServer/LicenseServer?
action=get_license&cas=1&content_id=javacar&userid=user1&shopid=shop1
 
The content_id, userid, and shopid are sent to the license server and 
the EMM or License is returned in response.
 


----------------------------
Additional libraries needed
----------------------------
1) Database JDBC Driver: The JAR file containing the appropriate JDBC
driver for the database being used, must be placed in the tomcat or
application server's classpath. 
The driver com.pointbase.jdbc.jdbcUniversalDriver used in the sample 
configuration, is available in the pbembedded.jar file from the relevant 
pointbase version.

2) commons-fileupload: The commons-fileupload-1.0.jar is used to
support the uploading of the binary license files. Hence you would need
to download that file from http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/fileupload/
and add it to the tomcat or application server's classpath.
