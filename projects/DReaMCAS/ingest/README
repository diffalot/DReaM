
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run ./bootstrap (you must have libtools and autotools and the stream editor
   'sed' in your path)
2. Run 'configure' after setting environment variable LD to point to the 
   compiler You are using. 
   
   For Sun Compilers, use the C++ compiler to compile both the C and C++ files.
  
   bash$ CC=CC CXX=CC LD=CC ./configure --with-cacrypto=<cacrytpo-install-path> --with-boost-dir=<libboost install location>
   
   For GNU compilers:
   
   bash$ CC=gcc CXX=g++ LD=gcc ./configure \ --with-cacrypto=<cacrytpo-install-path> --with-boost-dir=<libboost install location>
   
   (Note that the default linker (ld) used by libtool seems to have some trouble
   in getting the shared libraries to work cleanly)
   
   The ca_crypto sources are available in the DReaMCAS/common/ca_crypto library.
3. make


We have used Version 5.8 of Sun C and C++ compilers and Version 3.4.5 of gcc and
g++ to successfully build the DReaMCAS codebase.


DEPENDENCIES

The ingest code has the following dependencies:

1. ca_crypto library: This is indicated in step 2 of the Build instructions 
   above.
2. C++ Boost library from http://www.boost.org.
 
   For compiling on Solaris using Sun's compilers, See this Simon Atanasyan blog
   entry: http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/sga?entry=boost_mini_howto
   
   The version used (and expected by the configure script) is version 1_32. 
  
 (NOTE: The dependency on libs/mmp was removed by using libs/mpeg2 for parsing MPEG2
        streams. So, the ingest code should build on non-Solaris platforms, as well.) 


USAGE

The encryption ingest implementation which use the ca_crypto libraries are 
found under apps/cas_encrypt.  There are two applications available: 
encryptTs and emmEncrypt.  The encryptTs encrypts an MPEG-2 TS using 
either a provided or default stream key.  It also outputs the access key
in an EMM file.  The emmEncrypt is used to encrypt the EMM using the 
public key of the recipient.  Please refer to the README.txt file found 
in the apps/cas_encrypt directory for usage instructions.  For more 
information on the specifications of DReaM-CAS, please visit
