SOURCE Instructions
-------------------
Download the source files from the dream cvs.

An additional file must be downloaded from openssh.com. 

The file provide aes counter mode support and may be obtained from:
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/usr.bin/ssh/cipher-ctr.c?rev=1.6

Note that the version number of the file is "revision 1.6" in the openssh.com CVS.

This file must be altered in the followig way:
- Remove "includes.h" and RCISD reference at the top of the file.
- Include <string.h> which provides prototypes for memcpy and memset.
- Remove all references to xmalloc and xfree (xmalloc.h) since these headers are not
  available in the DReaM source distribution. Use the regular malloc and free
  instead.
- Remove all references to functions from log.h, such as fatal(). Replace with
  your own fatal error handler function call.
- In the evp_aes_128_ctr function change the aes_ctr.block_size value to 1 from
  AES_BLOCK_SIZE.

(Openssl must be downloaded and installed separately and is not distributed
with this package.)

(2) Install libtools and autotools on your system. Then execute 
# ./bootstrap

(3) Execute configure to generate the Makefiles
# ./configure --with-openssl=<openssl-install-path> [--prefix=<some-path>]

(4) Execute "make" to build the files
# make

(5) Do a "make install" to install the headers and the libraries 
# make install
