Detailed instructions on how to build VLC with DReaMCAS and DReaMMMI rights
support on linux (x86) including installing all required libraries.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
****************
* Introduction *
****************
Building VLC is a bit tedious since there are a large number of libraries
that it depends on. This file contains instructions that may be used to build
your VLC player. There are obviously many ways to build the VLC player and this
file lists just one of the possible ways. This may not work for everyone but it
should useful for people working on most of the latest distrubutions.

I would suggest that you use a package manager like "yum" on
Fedora Core or "apt-get" on debian and variants to get these packages, rather than
download and compile the libraries yourself. Some libraries are required to be
compiled from sources and they are specifically called out in the instructions
below.


*************************
* Detailed Installation *
*************************
At the very minimum, the configure script required to configure VLC for use with
DReaMCAS is the following:

./configure --x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib --enable-debug --enable-a52 --enable-ffmpeg --with-ffmpeg-tree=${FFMPEG_DIR} --enable-livedotcom --enable-dvbpsi --with-livedotcom-tree=/home/gautam/work/vlc/live --enable-wx --with-wx-config-path=${WX_DIR} --enable-cas --with-cacrypto=${CACRYPTO_DIR} --with-cadec=${CADEC_DIR} --enable-rightsxface --with-rightsxface=${RIGHTSXFACE_DIR}

Examining the above line you can see that you need at least the following
packages:
ffmpeg source tree
livedotcom source tree
dvbpsi development package
wxGTK source tree (or development package)
cacrypto source tree
cadec source tree
rightsxface source tree

The rightsxface source tree may use the MMIRightsManager source code to get MMI
rights information.

Installing packages
-------------------
Using the package manager system on my linux installation - Ubuntu (a debian
based one), my install log showed that I installed the following packages.

libcairo2-dev (1.0.2-0ubuntu1.1)
libexpat1-dev (1.95.8-3)
libfontconfig1-dev (2.3.2-1ubuntu4)
libfreetype6-dev (2.1.7-2.4ubuntu1)
libglib2.0-dev (2.8.3-0ubuntu1)
libpango1.0-dev (1.10.1-0ubuntu1)
libpng12-dev (1.2.8rel-1ubuntu3)
libxft-dev (2.1.7-1ubuntu5)
libxrender-dev (1:0.9.0-1)
libcomerr2 (1.38-2ubuntu1)
x-dev (6.8.99.15+cvs.20050722-1)
x11proto-render-dev (1:0.9.0-1)
libmad0 (0.15.1b-2.1)
libmad0-dev (0.15.1b-2.1)
libmpeg2-4 (0.4.0b-2ubuntu4)
libmpeg2-4-dev (0.4.0b-2ubuntu4)
libdvbpsi3 (0.1.4-2)
libdvbpsi3-dev (0.1.4-2)
make (3.80-9)
libcurl3-dev (7.14.0-2ubuntu1.2)
libidn11-dev (0.5.13-1.0)
libssl-dev (0.9.7g-1ubuntu1.1)
zlib1g-dev (1:1.2.3-3ubuntu4)
autoconf (2.59a-3)
automake1.9 (1.9.5-1)
m4 (1.4.3-1)
autotools-dev (20050422.1)
libtool (1.5.6-6)
binutils (2.16.1-2ubuntu6)
cpp-3.4 (3.4.4-6ubuntu8.1)
g++-3.4 (3.4.4-6ubuntu8.1)
gcc-3.4 (3.4.4-6ubuntu8.1)
gcc-3.4-base (3.4.4-6ubuntu8.1)
libstdc++6-dev (3.4.4-6ubuntu8.1) 

On Fedora boxes the "-dev" packages will be available as "-devel" packages.

I would recommend using gcc-3.4 for compiling the sources rather than the default
gcc-4.0+ compilers that come by default with most new distros. 

Hence I use the following changes to set the CC and the CXX env variables.

$ echo "export CC=gcc-3.4" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export CXX=g++-3.4" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

Downloading and compiling various source packages
==============================================================================
All instructions below assume the following directory structure

base_dir
   wxGTK-2.6.3
   live
   ffmpeg-20051126
   DReaM

$ cp DReaM/DReaMCAS/vlc_update/configure.txt vlc-0.8.2/.
$ cp DReaM/DReaMCAS/vlc_update/DReaM-VLC-configure.sh vlc-0.8.2/.
$ cd vlc-0.8.2
$ ./bootstrap
$ chmod a+x DReaM-VLC-configure.sh
$ vi DReaM-VLC-configure.sh
<change FFMPEG_DIR to ~/base_dir/ffmpeg-20051126>

<change CADEC_DIR to install dir>
<change CACRYPTO_DIR to install dir>
<change RIGHTSXFACE_DIR to install dir>
$ ./DReaM-VLC-configure.sh
$ make

This should build. If not, chances are that some of the libraries are not
available or are not in the usual places. You might want to tinker with the
configure.ac to make sure that the paths supplied are correct.

BUILD Instructions
------------------

(See vlc-long-help.txt for some detailed build/install notes)

(1) Untar vlc-0.8.2 source code.

(2) Apply source patch using something like

# patch -p0 < DReaM-CAS-VLC.patch

(The example above assumes that vlc-0.8.2 is a folder in the same folder where
the patch resides)

(3) copy configure.txt into the vlc-0.8.2 directory.

(4) The DReaM-CAS patch for vlc requires the development versions of the
following packages
- libcacrypto (0.1) (package maintained and distributed with the DReaM source
  code)
-libcadec (0.1) (package maintained and distributed with the DReaM source code)
- openssl (0.9.7f) (Not included here. To be installed separately)
- libcurl (7.13.1) (Not included here. To be installed separately) 
- rightsxface (package maintained and distributed with the DReaM source code)
- mmi_rights_mgr (package maintained and distributed with the DReaM source code)

library version numbers indicate the versions that the implementation was tested with.

(5) It is recommended to use the sample DReaM-VLC-configure.sh shell script to
configure your vlc-0.8.2 installation before building it. You should install
development versions of the libraries used in the configure script.

(6) Once the vlc code has been successfully configured, use "make" to build the
code.


***********
* Running *
***********
Ensure that all the libraries built are in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and the
mmi_rights_mgr library is in the CLASSPATH.

Invoke vlc with:
$ ./vlc <media_url>

where media_url is the url of the DReaM managed media resource.

To use in the DReaM configuration, use the following command:

#!/bin/sh
export CLASSPATH=./MMIRightsManager.jar:./MMICommon.jar
./vlc -vvvvv --extraintf rc --rc-host localhost:3232
