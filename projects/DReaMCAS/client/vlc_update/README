This directory contains source code patch that may be applied to the
Videolan Client media player source code. The patch enables the player to
interact with a DReaMCAS and DReaMMMI servers.

The DReaMCAS functionality has been implemented as per the DReaMCAS
specification and is capable of acquiring a DReaMCAS license to decrypt and
decode DReaMCAS encrypted media content. It also enables the VLC client to send
fastforward and rewind RTSP events, which was not supported as of VLC v0.8.2.

The DReAMMMI functionality has been implemented so that it employs a generic
rights interface plugin to discern if the player is permitted to perform various
actions such as play, fastforward, rewind etc. The implementation is incomplete
and the player does not make use of a lot of other DReaMMMI functionality such
as transcoding, rights management for counts, duration or period.

Please refer to the INSTALL file for instructions on how to build and run the
player.
