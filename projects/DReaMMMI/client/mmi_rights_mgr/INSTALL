To build:
---------

Building this library requires the MMICommon.jar which can be located in the
DReaM/DReaMMMI/common project directory. This jar file must be placed in
libs/java/

To build:

> ant

Optional:
You may specify an install directory in the build.xml file where you want to
install all the jar files required by a client. The MMICommon.jar and the
MMIRightsManager.jar will be placed in this install directory. After the install
you will also have to include these jars in your CLASSPATH for things to work.

> ant install-jars
> export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:<jar-install-dir>/MMICommon.jar:<jar-install-dir>/MMIRightsManager.jar

Running
-------
This will depend upon the client and how these libraries are intended to be used
by the client. For running with the VLC client please see instructions in the
DReaM/misc/vlc-update

Other executables:
------------------
A test MMIClient can be executed to check the connectivity with the MMIServer.
To run this client:

java -cp build/libs/java/MMIRightsManager.jar org.omc.dream.mmi.client.MMIClient http://server:port/DReaMLicensor/LicenseServer
