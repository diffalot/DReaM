MMI client code README
-----------------------

The client code contains two major classes:
- MMIRightsManager
- MMIClient

MMIRightsManager manages MMI rights on the client side. A client application
can query the MMIRightsManager to check if the application has rights to
perform certain functions. The MMIRightsManager may satisfy the request by
referring to its internal repository if it already contains this information
or it may formulate requests using the MMI protocol to get this information
from the server.

MMIClient implements code that is used to communicate with the MMIServer.
Connectivity with the MMIServer can be tested using the instructions in the
INSTALL file.
