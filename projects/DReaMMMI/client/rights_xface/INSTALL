Building
--------

Building this library requires a JAVA installation since this library, invokes
the JVM and runs the MMIRightsManager.jar library within the JVM. It then
channels all requests it gets to the MMIRightsManager object in the JVM.

To specify the location of your java installation set the JAVA_HOME environment
variable and then invoke `make`.

To summarize:

0. edit Makefile; set INSTALL_PATH
1. export JAVA_HOME=<java_path>
2. make
3. make install
