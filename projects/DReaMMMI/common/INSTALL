DReaM/DReaMMMI/common/INSTALL

Prerequisites
-------------
JavaCC 4.0 - Java Compiler-Compiler 4.0 (found at http://javacc.dev.java.net)
Apache Ant 1.6.5 - http://ant.apache.org
JDK1.4 or greater - http://java.sun.com


Build Instructions
------------------
1) Download the binary distribution from http://javacc.dev.java.net and extract.

2) Modify the "javacchome" entry in DReaM/DReaMMMI/common/build.xml to reflect 
the correct path of the javacc

3) Go to the "DReaM/DReaMMI/common" directory and run ant.  This should result 
in the generation of the "MMICommon.jar" in the DReaM/DReaM/common/dist


Troubleshooting:
----------------
1) Java code not compiling on Linux platform

Solution: Check if the version of java is correct.  If it is reported as a 
gij (GNU libgcj), then download the appropriate Sun JDK and add that to 
the PATH.

2) Ant is reporting the following error:
...
BUILD FAILED
/cvs/dream/DReaM/DReaMMMI/common/build.xml:14: Could not create task or type of type: javacc.
...

Solution: Check the ant version (1.6.5) and make sure that the binary 
distribution of Ant from http://ant.apache.org is used.
